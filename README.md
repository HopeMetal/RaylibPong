# Raylib Pong

A pong game I wrote to practice C++ and Raylib, but it has one annyoing feature: the enemy paddle randomly changes its y position to the y position of the ball, comes closer to the center of the screen and changes size.

### Compiling
After installing Raylib it should be enough to open the workspace in Visual Studio Code and run the Build Task.
